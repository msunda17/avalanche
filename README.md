# Project Avalanche

### To-do

1. Add Memory Updation UI for Saving User Profile Pages
- Whenever the user tries to create some new page and tells the gpt to call it profile page or something, we will update our memory (data store) and add this to our rag
2. UI 
    - Use material design theme
    - Responsiveness - bootstrap
2. Canvas
    - Use existing react canvas libraries
        - Drag and drop (from list of objects)
        - Drag in the canvas to create a shape
